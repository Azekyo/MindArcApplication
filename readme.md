###### Bonus points

The reason ('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase() returns 'banana' is because 'b' + expects a string to concat to 'b' but receives +'a' which JavaScript is attempting to convert into a number when it sees the extra plus sign ( unary plus operator ) before the operand of 'a', this fails to return a number and instead returns NaN ( Not A Number ) which when converted to lower case becomes 'nan', so 'b'+'a'+'nan'+'a' = 'banana' :) 

Thanks for the chance to apply, look forward to talking if you liked the code.git
